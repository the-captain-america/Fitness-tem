		title: `Overview Performance Preferences`,
		contents: [
			`The Performance Preference assessmentTM is a preference tool designed to help leaders
			identify their natural preferences as they relate to human action.`,
			`These preferences help leaders sort through how they naturally respond to initiatives of all
			kinds. Each preference is valued and important for effective, high performance action to
			take place. Knowing one’s preferences helps leaders understand where they can make their
			best contribution to the action at hand and where they need to step aside and draw out
			others’ contributions.`,
			`Although leaders can develop preferences that they are not as strong in using, it must be
			noted that natural preferences are like highways in the mind, they lend themselves to quick
			insight, wisdom (through years of experience), and thought modes not found in lesser
			developed preferences. In a sense they are more like talents that people naturally gravitate
			towards when processing data and making decisions.`

		title: `Using the Action Wheel to Optimize
		Team Performance`,
		contents: [
			`Dr. Robert Terry spent forty years wrestling with the idea of action. His thoughts and
	theory of leadership are recorded in his seminal book, Authentic Leadership: Courage in
	Action. The heart of Terry’s research concluded that there are six and only six dimensions
	for any and every action that is taken. Never seven, never five, always six; and leaders
	must learn how to leverage each dimension of action if they are to achieve successful
	outcomes.`,
			`With six dimensions of action as a baseline Terry concluded that leadership is a subsection
	of action. Understand action, and leaders can move from an anchored grounded position to
	explore a philosophy for leadership, how influence can move people to successful action, and
	how to probe action to achieve authenticity.`,
			`The framework for these dimensions was developed over many years of discussion and
	debate culminating in a practical model called, The Action WheelTM. The Action Wheel is a
	wheel connecting each dimension of action in an applied concrete process. Leadership
	theory was reflected through each of Terry’s six dimensions.`,
			`If Terry’s hypothesis is true, then all leadership theory, and practical application of
	leadership can and should find a home within one of the six dimensions of action.
	Furthermore, the integration of Terry’s six dimensions of action should be able to narrate
	any and all discussions on how successful action occurs and takes place.`,
			`Over the years Terry’s model has been linked to retaining talent, identifying and resolving
	organizational issues, providing a map for making great decisions, bringing about
	successful change and quality initiatives, improving morale, providing a successful
	template for strategy implementation and, the elevating of team performance.`,
			`Elevating team performance is the focus of this assessment. Just as each of us has physical
	defaults, like right- or left-handedness, we also each have 'performance defaults' that
	inform how we approach our work.`,
			`Have you ever wondered why some projects run smoothly from concept to completion, while

	other initiatives suddenly go off the rails? Do you find that you work well with some co-
	workers yet find it difficult, or even impossible, to work with others?`,
			`Our Performance Preferences Assessment will help you discover your own performance
	profile and explore how differences that frustrate you can be understood and even become the key to optimizing team performance.`,
			`Each Performance Preference is connected to one dimension of action. All are required for
	action to move forward successfully. We all do each dimension every day in some way or
	another. Yet, each of us has a default connection with one, two, or even three dimensions of
	action.`,
			`The purpose of the Performance Preference Assessment tool is to make the six dimensions
	of action understandable and useful in people's lives. Seemingly random behavior is
	actually quite orderly and consistent when seen within the six dimensions of action. Each
	dimension of action has its own characteristics that reflect one aspect of action. While we
	all do all six dimensions every day for any number of actions, we still have an overarching
	preference to focus on certain action dimensions while ignoring or deflecting other
	dimensions of action that are just as important for successful action to take place.`,
			`The aim of this tool is provide insights into individuals and groups as to how they operate,
	what they highlight and what they ignore. The action framework provides a foundation for
	individuals and teams to see and experience the power of all the dimensions operating in
	sync with each other while conversely helping individuals and teams understand what is
	lacking when all the dimensions are not being represented in an action.`,
			`Performance Preferences takes each dimension of action and turns it into a preference. On
	the following pages you will learn which preference you are most comfortable with and
	which you find to be uncomfortable. Remember, we all do each dimension on a daily basis,
	yet, at the same time we have a comfort level with some dimensions and a discomfort level
	with others.`
